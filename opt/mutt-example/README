Place this example file in $HOME/.mutt/imap . Also, generate an encrypted file
like so:

	$ gpg --encrypt -r RECIPIENT > ~/.mutt/pass
	my_imap_password
	<C-d>

Fill in the reset of the personal information of .mutt/imap.
Enjoy :)

Note: "RECIPIENT" is the name of the user who setup gpg. Setup gpg with the following:

	$ gpg --gen-key
	.... ( lots of setup ) ...
